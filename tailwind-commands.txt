-> flex: Makes the div a flex container, aligning child elements horizontally by default.
-> justify-between: Distributes space between child elements, pushing them to the far left and right.
-> items-center: Vertically centers the items in the container.
-> p-4: Adds padding on all sides (p stands for padding, and 4 is a standard spacing size in Tailwind).
